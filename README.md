An intelligent **Movie Recommendation System** built in **Google Colab** using **content-based filtering**.  
It suggests similar movies to a user’s favorite by analyzing genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director from a dataset.

## 📖 Overview  

This project demonstrates a **Content-Based Recommendation Engine** for movies.  
The system uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** to find relationships between movies and provide personalized recommendations.  

- Input: A movie name (typed by the user).  
- Output: A ranked list of movies similar in content.

## ✨ Features  

- 🔍 **Content-Based Filtering**: No user history required — recommendations are based solely on movie attributes.  
- 🧩 **Feature Engineering**: Combines `genres`, `keywords`, `tagline`, `cast`, and `director`.  
- 🧮 **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text features into numerical vectors.  
- 📐 **Cosine Similarity**: Measures closeness between movies.  
- 🎯 **Close Match Handling**: Uses fuzzy matching (`difflib`) to accept similar user inputs.  
- 📊 **Top-N Recommendations**: Suggests up to 30 similar movies.

👉 Do you want me to also design a **cover banner (project image)** for this repo (like “Movie Recommendation System 🎬”) so it looks more attractive at the very top of GitHub?
